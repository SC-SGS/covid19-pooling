We provide a [website](https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/sgs/cgi-bin/JA/covid19/) which performs this simulation in an intuitive  user-friendly interface. Unfortunately we cannot perform high-accuracy runs online, because the execution times would be unbearable. Instead we are using a fixed reference population of 10,000 individuals. The results are then scaled to the user-specific input.  For more accurate solutions you can clone this repository and execute the code on your computer using any desired parameter combination.
